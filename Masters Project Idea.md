## Idea 1 (Experiment Graph Execution/Code Generation with Instructions)
This idea comes from Big Data and Predictive Analytics

The basic Idea is to create a code generation program that generates python scripts.

The user spells out how experiments should be designed in a very high level, but structured description. (I'll have to design the language).

The generated code can then be inspected by the user for verification

An option to skip manual code verification and proceed straight to execution should also be made available
